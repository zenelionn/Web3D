This is my Web3D project.

Inside you will find all blender files, images, glbs and code for this assignment.

In order to run the website, please ensure you have live server installed. Then open the file titled "home.html" and in the bottom right corner hit the button that says "Go Live".
Give it a few moments and it should open up to the front page of my website. From here you can  use the navbar to navigate through the website.

Thank you very much.
